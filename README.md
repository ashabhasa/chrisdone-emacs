Note: For a basic Haskell + Emacs setup with no other specific config, see
my other
[emacs-haskell-config](https://github.com/chrisdone/emacs-haskell-config)
repository.

# Emacs configuration

To use

    $ git submodule init
    $ git submodule update
    $ cd packages/haskell-mode; make
    $ cd packages/structured-haskell-mode; cabal update; cabal install; cd elisp; make
    $ cabal install hasktags haskell-docs
    $ cabal install present

Optionally, for browsing haddocks inside Emacs:

    $ sudo apt-get install w3m

### I'm just here to see your Haskell config

Then you want to look inside
[config/haskell.el](https://github.com/chrisdone/chrisdone-emacs/blob/master/config/haskell.el)
and steal anything that looks interesting.

### Use without affecting existing Emacs configuration

This is perfect for the “just looking” use-case.

    $ emacs -Q -l init.el

### Use by modifying `.emacs`

Put only this in your `.emacs`

    (load "/path-to/chrisdone-emacs/init.el")

and run Emacs as normal.

### Use by checking out as `~/.emacs.d/`

Check out this project or symlink it as `~/.emacs.d/` and then run
Emacs as normal.

### Weird stuff you might want to disable

You might want to comment out the following things in [init.el](https://github.com/chrisdone/chrisdone-emacs/blob/master/init.el).

God-mode is a modal input mode for Emacs like Vim:

    (god-mode)

If you prefer a dark terminal, comment out this:

    (sunburn)
